<img src="https://github.com/HelloNatalia/systemBiblioteczny/blob/readmeimages/index-client.PNG"/>


## üîç Project Overview

This application was created to **manage library tasks**. It is separated into frontend (client side) and backend (library, internal side). 

<br>

### Backend - side managed by employees - the ‚ù§Ô∏è of the application

The backend part is intended to be used by library employees. There are many functions to create, edit, manage, etc. all important information.
An employee has own admin account on the application and can manage books (see, create, edit, delete, borrow to the reader), borrows (see, create, extend the deadline, settle cash arrears), readers (create, edit, see borrowed books), can also see reports like all borrows, returns, the status of books in the library. 


### Frontend - client side

This part enables a client to signup and login by 'reader ID'. Thanks to that the logged-in user has access to his borrowed books, can see how many days are left to the deadline, and what's importantly, can extend the deadline online. 

Of course, on every page is a possibility to search for a specific record with **autocomplete forms**, there are also sorting options for many data.

<br>
